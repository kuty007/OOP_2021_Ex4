## Introduction
This project is an final assignment in an object-oriented course at Ariel University.
In this project we implemented a simple Pokemon game. The game is running by a simle server, and a client that receiving information from the server such as: graph structure, location of the Pokemon, the amount and speed of the agents and more. On our side we have implemented algorithms to optimize the agents work by efective allocation to pokemons. Also we build a pygame design to the client side.

## Creating and Implementing Directed Weighted Graph Theory.
This project had 2 main part: in the first part we had to implemment an Directed Weighted Graph,
in the second part we implement and run some algorhitms that we build on the DWG to check some skills.
The issue of the second part is to compare run time between 2 programming languages java VS python about same assignment.
